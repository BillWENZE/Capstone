# Introduction
This proposal outlines the approach to studying the relationship between M&A premiums and Qualcomm Inc.'s long-term performance, focusing on three acquisitions in the semiconductor industry between 2011 and 2022. Due to the limited number of acquisitions, the analysis will explore premium calculation methodologies and long-term performance metrics based on available data. Understanding this link is crucial, as overpaying in M&A can negatively impact long-term value, posing significant financial risks.

# Methodology
## 1. M&A Premium Calculation for Target Companies
We will calculate the M&A premium on two bases: **absolute** and **relative**.

### Absolute Premium:
- Measure the difference between the offer price and the target's pre-announcement stock price.
- This will be measured across various time intervals:
  - 1-day
  - 1-week
  - 1-month

### Relative Premium:
- Compare the premium to **industry-wide** and **market-wide** M&A premium averages within the semiconductor sector during the same time frame.

## 2. Long-Term Performance Measurement for Qualcomm Inc.
We will evaluate long-term performance based on **stock performance** and **operating performance**.

### Stock Performance:
- Track Qualcomm's performance on both an **absolute** and **relative** basis.
- Use **factor analysis**:
  - **CAPM** (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
  - **Fama-French 3-factor model**
- Use **valuation analysis**:
  - **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio**
  - **Enterprise Value/Revenue (EV/Revenue)**
  - **Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)**

### Operating Performance:
- Analyze key operating metrics, including:
  - **Revenue growth**
  - **Profit margins**
  - **Free cash flow (FCF)**
  - **Return on Assets (ROA)**
  - **Return on Equity (ROE)**
  - **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**
- Consider **merger impairments** or **write-offs** that could impact long-term performance.

# Data Collection
To effectively analyze the relationship between M&A premiums and long-term performance of acquirers, this study will rely on a combination of financial databases, market benchmarks, and company-specific financial statements. We use **Bloomberg** as the primary source for detailed M&A transaction data and company financial data, such as stock price and financial performance. Additionally, we choose **S&P 500** and **Semiconductor industry’s ETF** as our market benchmarks. 

For instance, **SEC filings**, including **10-K** and **10-Q** reports, will be used to extract detailed financial metrics for Qualcomm Inc.

---

# Established Hypotheses
We develop the following hypotheses to test the relationship between M&A premiums and performance:

1. **Higher M&A premiums** are associated with **better long-term stock performance**.
2. **Higher M&A premiums** are associated with **better long-term operating performance**.
3. **Higher premiums** may negatively impact performance due to **overpayment**.

---

# Expected Outcomes
Through a detailed analysis of Qualcomm’s M&A premiums and their relationship with long-term stock performance and key operating metrics, we aim to gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s M&A strategies in driving long-term value creation. 

Specifically, the study will evaluate whether the premiums paid for acquisitions were justified by improvements in financial performance. Additionally, we expect to identify a reasonable range of M&A premiums that can inform and guide future M&A decisions within the **semiconductor industry**.
